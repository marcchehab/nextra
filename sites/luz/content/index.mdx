# Welcome, Hoi, Hola

I'm Marc, and this is **my knowledge garden about politics**. I tend my garden mostly in English and German, and sometimes in Spanish, depending on what makes the most sense in any given situation. If the language barrier becomes a problem, I suggest using [a translation service like Google Translate](https://www-luz-to.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp).
