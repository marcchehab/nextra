title: Finally credible European position on Ukraine?

The last thing Biden did: He gave permission to use US arms for long range onto russian territory. it is a policy that's been overdue since the russian full scale asssault on februrary 2022.

US and European leaders have tried to come up with a credible position of restraining ukraine's right to self defence.
- no f16 fighterjets, , but then yes 
- no himars, then yes
- ... list further examples

the inability of formulating a coherent position results in a confused meandering that no one understands. this is allthemore frustrating given that an established,  coherent, and supremely defensible position already exists:

Ukraine's right to proportional self-defence under international law.

### Blog Post: Supporting Ukraine's Right to Self-Defence Without Restriction

In a decisive policy shift, President Joe Biden recently allowed Ukraine to use American-supplied arms for long-range strikes on Russian territory. This overdue move reflects the growing recognition of Ukraine's legitimate right to self-defence under international law—a right it has been exercising since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022.

For nearly two years, U.S. and European leaders have struggled to articulate a consistent stance on military support for Ukraine. Initially, F-16 fighter jets were deemed off-limits; now, they are on their way. HIMARS rocket systems followed a similar trajectory—from denial to deployment. This hesitancy to embrace a unified position has resulted in erratic policy changes, leading to confusion among allies and adversaries alike.

Such dithering is particularly frustrating given that a clear, coherent, and defensible position already exists: Ukraine’s right to proportional self-defence. Enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter, this principle grants all nations the right to defend themselves against aggression. By continually second-guessing how Ukraine should fight for its survival, the West risks undermining its own credibility and the values it claims to uphold.

Restricting Ukraine’s use of weapons—based on fears of escalation—ignores the harsh realities of war. The aggressor, not the defender, sets the limits of violence. Russia has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to escalate, attacking civilian infrastructure and ignoring international norms. Expecting Ukraine to fight with one hand tied behind its back neither deters Moscow nor protects Europe’s security. On the contrary, it emboldens authoritarian aggression.

The solution is not more ambiguity or delayed decisions but full support for Ukraine's sovereignty and its right to self-defence. Western leaders must embrace this principle unequivocally, supplying Ukraine with the tools it needs to defend its territory and citizens effectively. Anything less risks not only prolonging the conflict but also compromising the moral and legal foundations of the international order. 

Ukraine’s struggle is not just its own; it is a test of the global commitment to the rule of law and the right to resist tyranny. Let us not fail this test through indecision or misplaced caution.
